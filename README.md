# classification-mini-project

This project works to create a miniscule pipeline to run multiple classification algorithms at once and plot the scores of those in a bar graph. Helps to speeden lower level EDA.

The algorithms being used are:
* Logistic regression

* Support vector machine (SVM)
  
* K-nearest neighbor (KNN)

* Decision tree classifier

* Random forest classifier

* The following are implemented but commented out.
  - Extremely random trees classifier

  - Gradient boosting classifier

  -  Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) classifier

The datasets are available at the links in the references.
